# Coding Conventions

## Comment flags

 * TODO - a new feature or list of new features
 * FIXME - flag either a bug or serious kludge (there should be no FIXME's in a release)
 * NOTE - a slightly ominous flag indicating followed by something important

Examples:
``` haskell
-- TODO:
--  [ ] make it faster
--  [ ] make it better

-- NOTE: The following code doesn't work on Tuesdays

-- FIXME: Remove the hardcoded filenames in the following code
```
